# filth-maker

Previously, the assistant director of Nature Camp had to spend many hours creating the duty sheet (or "filth roster") by hand before every session. This was tedious, and the schedule often contained various errors that had to be corrected later. This program, which is written in HTML and Javascript, will create the filth automatically, hopefully saving future assistant directors many hours of work for years to come.


Here is an example of an old filth roster (created before this program), to give an idea of what the final product of this program will look like.

Things to note:
    -Extra kitchens (i.e. once everyone has already been assigned two kitchens) are random; the program does not favor giving an extra kitchen to people who have it on "half" days like the first or middle Sunday, or the last Saturday.
    -Kitchen is the only duty that is tracked to make sure people don't get it too many times
    -If you want a staff member to be a cook for a certain day, just add them to the DOP that day and they won't be dutied
    -As of 06/16/2022, this program is only compatible with Google Chrome.
    -As of 06/16/2022, you must enter each staff member as either female or male staff. It will not affect how they are assigned duties. This will be updated in the future.
    -As of 06/16/2022, this program does not assign bunkhouse duties or graces at meals, as the gender neutral housing situation is still a work in progress. This program will be updated in the future to work with the updated housing/duty system
    -Staff members that are NOT assigned to a duty on a given day are listed below the DOP section, as "undutied" staffmembers
    -This program does nothing to ensure that someone does not get non-kitchen duties multiple times. For example, someone might get assigned rec four days in a row. The AD can fix
    this manually
