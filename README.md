# This program will generate a duty sheet for Nature Camp (a summer camp), hopefully saving the assistant director many hours of tedious work.
# The user enters the names of staff members, and then enters their days off.
# The program uses this info to generate a table (a "filth roster") with all duties for each day filled out.
